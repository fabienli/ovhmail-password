This is a small script to setup on your OVH mutualisated server to manage email passwords

To install, follow the following steps :
1) create a config.php file. Copy the config_sample.php file to config.php and edit the file to set your OVH nic-handle and you password. The file should look like this :
<?php
$domain = "yourdomain.tld"; // your domain name
$serveur="pop3.". $domain;
$dom = "@". $domain;
// API token created from https://api.ovh.com/createToken/
$application_key = 'c*Y*A*f*K*y*h*e3';
$application_secret = 'c*8*R*w*x*1*5*6*R*K*f*H*a*E*t*rW';
$endpoint = 'ovh-eu';
$consumer_key = '7*e*z*E*x*H*9*L*p*2*z*E*x*5*w*eT';
?>
